Written in python 3.3 32-bit.

Installation and packaging
--------------------------
Will attempt to freeze app with cx_freeze, if it fails, I'll look for more options.


Requirements
------------
PySide python qt bindings (or pyqt4, with some minimal changes you can convert pyside to pyqt 4)
[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PySide](more information on pyside)

Pywin32
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/](download)
These are the bindings for the win32api to python. 

The rest of the libs used are builtins.
