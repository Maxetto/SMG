Unless you have experience with JSON, it's not a great idea to start messing around in music_players.json.
Even then, read the parameters down below. Making mistakes in the file will make smg behave very strangely.
Watch out for: a space too much, incorrect json notation, forgetting brackets for lists,
 forgetting required parameters, incorrect capitalisation, spelling errors and probably a lot more.
if you (think) you messed up too hard, you can simply remove music_players.json and it will be replaced with the default file the moment you start smg.

========================================================================================EXAMPLE FOR A MUSIC APPLICATION JSON NOTATION================================================================================
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A music player is as follows:
"NAME": {
    "name": "music_player_name",
    "apptype": pick between either "music_player" or "web_music_player",
    "identifiers": ["Fictional super music player v3.02"],
    "window_class_name": "QWidget",
    "replace_title": True,
    "remove_characters": ["playing", "paused"]
}

========================================================================================MUSIC APPLICATION PARAMETERS=================================================================================================
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have three different kinds of parameters.
First is a string, it's just text with double quotation marks around them. "". ex: "apple", "something", "music".
Second is a boolean, it can be either False or True. (NOTE THE CAPITALISATION)
Last is a list, it contains multiple strings between brackets, each string is delimited by a comma.
 Ex: ["first_string", "second_string", "nobody likes apples anymore"]


An application has the following parameters:

required:
REQUIRED string: name, this is the name that will be shown in the SMG selection box.

REQUIRED string: apptype, this is what kind of application we're working with. It can be either "music_player" or "web_music_player". A music player is anything that runs on your desktop
 a web music player is anything that runs in your browser.

REQUIRED list: identifiers, if SMG finds the identifier in the title of any program, it will take that program's title and uses it to find the song.
 It has to start with brackets [], you can have as many strings in there as you think you need.


Optional:
OPTIONAL string: window_class_name, this is a little more advanced, and it makes sure that if SMG finds multiple windows with your identifier(s) in it, it will only pick the correct one.
 See video for a more detailed explanation.
If your self added application behaves oddly, it's probably because there's no window class. You can find the window class with a spy tool such as AutoIt3 Window Spy. 
Note that this is how I personally add new music players, it takes some time to find the window class name, and sometimes you can't find it at all (or there is none at all).
 From no AutoIt3 knowledge to finding this (including installing, finding the spy tool, and then figuring out how to use it (it's really simple)) will take a few hours depending on how good you are with computers.
 If you aren't good with computers, I heavily recommend trying to skip this
DEFAULTS TO nothing. It will accept any window class name.

OPTIONAL boolean: replace_title, this is either True or False (watch capitalisation). If it's True, it will remove any found identifiers in the title. 
 example: title = "Spotify - some song by some band" 
          identifier = "Spotify - "
          if set to True the result will be: "some song by some band" 
          if set to False, the result will be: "Spotify - some song by some band"
DEFAULTS TO True.

OPTIONAL list: remove_characters, everything in this list will be removed from the title, if it is found. Note that this is NOT an identifier, it will simply always remove everything in this list.
 example: Youtube has a ▶ (should look like an arrow token >) in front of its title when a video is playing, it's not there if it's paused. 
          remove_characters: ["▶ "] will remove that from the title if it is found.
DEFAULTS TO [], an emtpy list, it won't do anything.
